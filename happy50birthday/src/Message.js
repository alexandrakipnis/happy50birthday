                    Hey pops! Since I am thousands of miles away from you on this special day, 
                    I thought that the best way for me to show my appreciation for you on your 50th
                    birthday would be through a handmade birthday website, all about you! With that being

                    Happy 50th birthday! I hope you have a wonderful day and a wonderful next year of life
                    absent of any unnecessary hardships and full of love from the people close to you. I am tremendously 
                    grateful for the effort and time you have put in to get me to where I am today. You have 
                    taught me how to face and overcome challenges that I otherwise would not be able to deal with. Though 
                    most of what I do is for my own future success, there is rarely a time that I don't wonder what 
                    you would think about my actions. Whether it be taking a more challenging class, joining a sorority, 
                    trying a new food (which we both know that I rarely do), and everything in between, I always want to 
                    make sure that you would be proud of my actions. I truly hope that this past year I have made you 
                    proud and that my presence is a positive in your life. I am sad that I only get to see you a few times 
                    a year now that I am in school and abroad so far away from you, but I think that it makes the time we 
                    do have together more meaningful. I love you and I know that you are not a big birthday person, but I 
                    still hope that today and this year is everything you want it to be and more.

                    P.S. I hope that you like the creativity of this birthday present. I've been working on it all summer 
                    during my free time in Israel using what I learned at XTern Bootcamp :)
